## Introduction, Project Overview

This repository displays my work with Tableau dashboards and visualizations.  

#### Goal:

The goal of this ongoing project is to:
1. Display the power of Tableau in summarizing data.
2. Document my use of this powerful Business Intelligence (BI) tool.  
3. Deepen my own understanding of Tableau's capabilities.



## Methodology:

Many of these visuals have been inspired by Tableau's ["Viz. of the Day"](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover/viz-of-the-day) newsletter.  When these visualizations are used to inspire my own self-created dashboards (as will be the case the majority of the time), this is my workflow:

1. Source the data (when available) that the original visualization was created from.  If the data is unavailable, I found similar data that can be repurposed to fit the scope of the dashboard.
2. Download a .png of the original dashboard to use as inspiration.
3. Use Tableau to recreate it!


## Data: 

The data for each visualization will be cited on the bottom left of the visualization itself.
